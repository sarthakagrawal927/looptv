## Why / What

Keep LoopTV a stable, lean-back, zero-API-key YouTube TV player. The product
surface is feature-complete for its current scope; active work is maintenance,
catalog freshness, and documentation hygiene.

## Dependencies

- Vite/React static app, YouTube embeds, Cloudflare Pages, and the versioned
  local catalog.
- Ultracite 7.10.2 is an exact development-only Biome preset dependency. Local
  exceptions preserve LoopTV's established Astro, catalog, and playback style;
  it does not affect the static runtime.

## Timeline

- **2026-09-07:** Deployed station layout/startup fixes passed [hosted desktop/mobile playback acceptance](docs/development/hosted-playback-qualification.md); issue #51 is complete. Preserve inactive/done scope.

- **2026-08-31:** Added source-ready product-owned Microsoft Clarity tracking
  and updated the privacy surface to disclose both analytics services. No
  deployment ran.
- **2026-08-12:** Adopted the Fleet code-health contract with truthful
  whole-library coverage, unused-code, cycle, complexity, duplication,
  dependency, suppression, build, docs, and repository-hygiene ratchets in CI;
  removed three unused public exports and recorded existing debt in GitHub.
- **2026-08-09:** Adopted the verified Ultracite-backed Biome baseline through
  the existing read-only check, with explicit compatibility exceptions and no
  source rewrite, catalog rebuild, production dependency, playback, or deploy
  change.
- **2026-07-31:** Replaced the catalog's always-expanded station tables with
  native disclosures. All 16 station summaries remain visible and
  keyboard-operable while the default 390px page is about 2,940px instead of
  13,975px; expanding a station reveals the same source and video detail.
- **2026-07-29:** Added an owned `/changelog` with verified release outcomes and
  direct GitHub Roadmap and Source links.
- Historical milestones live in [docs/archive/](docs/archive/).
